The idea is learning F# Async by real-world examples.

FileReading:
 Demo different facilities to open files.
 
ParallelPrimes:
 Get 3.5x speedup on a 4-core machine.
 The same speedup obtained for ManualEvents, Async and Array.Parallel.map compared to Synchronous version.

IO:
 Get 5.4x speedup for the IO-bound operation on 4-core machine.

Worker:
 Create workers to handle some events.

Form:
 Show Continuation support in F#.
